# Working with Autonomous Transaction Processing - Dedicated
</td></tr><table>

These workshop labs provide step-by-step directions to setting up and using your dedicated Autonomous database platform in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. 

Lab 100 deals with setting up the network, users and groups and requires administrator privileges on your OCI account

Labs 200 & 300 are geared towards the fleet administrator role responsible for deploying the autonomous exadata infrastructure and container databases

Labs 300 - 1000 are intended for a regular database user, DBA or developer who simply want to spin up an autonomous database in one of the pre-provisioned containers and start building applications

## Goals for this workshop
- Learn how to prepare your private data center in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
- Learn how to provision Exadata Infrastructure for Autonomous DB in OCI
- Learn how to provision an Autonomous Container Database
- Learn how to provision databases on your dedicated Autonomous Infrastructure
- Learn how to connect a developer client to an Autonomous Database
- Learn how to build and deploying Python application stacks on dedicated autonomous infrastructure
- Learn how to build and deploying node.js application stacks on dedicated autonomous infrastructure
- Learn how to build and deploying Java application stacks on dedicated autonomous infrastructure
- Learn how to use CLI commands to work with your Autonomous databases

# Workshop Overview

## Before You Begin
**What is an Autonomous Transaction Processing Dedicated?**
The dedicated infrastructure feature of Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing enables you to create an Oracle Autonomous Database platform that is private and isolated to your use all the way down to the Oracle Exadata hardware running your database instances and storing your database data.

You define and use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Networking and IAM (Identity and Access Management) resources to ensure secure and authorized use of your dedicated Autonomous Transaction Processing databases and the database resources that underlie them
