# Getting Started with Autonomous Transaction Processing Dedicated
</td></tr><table>


This workshop walks you through how to create private data center in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and provision Exadata Infrastructure for Autobnomious database and create your first Container and Pluggable database. This workshop also talks about how to connect your database to applications that are written in various languages like, Python, Java and Node.js. You will also learn how to use Oracle Command Line Interface to manage you database. 

## Goals for this workshop
- Learn how to prepare your private data center in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
- Learn how to provision Exadata Infrastructure for Autonomous DB in OCI
- Learn how to provision an Autonomous Container Database
- Learn how to provision databases on your dedicated Autonomous Infrastructure
- Learn how to connect a developer client to an Autonomous Database
- Learn how to build and deploying Python application stacks on dedicated autonomous infrastructure
- Learn how to build and deploying node.js application stacks on dedicated autonomous infrastructure
- Learn how to build and deploying Java application stacks on dedicated autonomous infrastructure
